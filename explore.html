                    <p>Café culture is a part of life in Paris, and no trip to the City of Light would be complete without a leisurely stop at one of its signature sidewalk brasseries for a coffee and croissant or a glass of wine.. But that’s just the beginning of the unforgettable adventure that is Parisian cuisine. For classic French fare like steak frites and souffle, try Maxim’s. Often called the most famous restaurant in the world, it’s a splurge, but a justified one. Don’t miss the opportunity to try the original, local versions of popular Parisian exports, such as macarons (stop at the original Laduree pastry shop at 16 Rue Royale) and cheese (the Androuet fromagerie on Rue de Verneil was named after the proprietor of the very first cheese shop in the world). And be sure to take advantage of the melting pot sensibility of Paris by sampling truly delicious foreign specialties like falafel (try L’As du Fallafel, located in Le Marais), Algerian couscous (Zerda Cafe in the 10th arrondissement has been serving it since 1946), and Senegalese yassa at Le Palanka (find it in the 4th arrondissement). Bon apetit!</p>

                    <p>Whether you’re visiting Paris for a week or a lifetime, you'll have more than enough attractions to keep you  busy. This is one city whose legendary sights don’t disappoint. Take the Eiffel Tower, for instance—sentimental, yes, but absolutely worth a close-up look. One of Paris’s most famous avenues, the Champs Elysees, displays many of the city’s showstoppers including the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. Stroll over to the 4th arrondissement for a visit to the Notre Dame Cathedral, completed in 1260 and known for its appearance in the works of Victor Hugo and others. A day trip is worth considering for a visit to the Palace of Versailles (30 minutes’ drive from the center of Paris). And you could spend an entire trip just touring the many remarkable and world-renowned museums of Paris, from the Louvre (where, if you’re lucky, you’ll be able to catch a glimpse of the Mona Lisa between the throngs of art lovers), the Musee d’Orsay (which houses Van Gogh’s Starry Night and Monet’s Water Lilies), and the Centre Pompidou (home to works by Dali, Miro, Rothko, and Pollock, among others).</p>

                    <p>It’s no coincidence that the word “fashion” has its origins in Old French. If shopping is on your travel agenda, you’ve certainly come to the right city. Start at the grand old department stores handsomely situated on the grand boulevards: Galeries Lafayette (on Boulevard Haussmann in the 9th arrondissement) and Printemps (located just a stone’s throw down Boulevard Haussmann from Lafayette). Label-seekers will want to make their way to Avenue Montaigne and Rue Saint Honore, where the flagship outposts of Parisian designers and fashion legends such as Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, and of course, Chanel, to name a few, can be found. And if you’re on the hunt for more off-the-beaten path treasures (quirky mementos, one-of-a-kind vintage pieces, or engrossing reads), try the Boulevards Saint Germain and Saint Michel on the Left Bank for bookstores, boutiques, and specialty shops.</p>

                    <p>Inspiring authors, filmmakers, and artist for over a century with its razzle-dazzle, the most famous cabaret in Paris, the Moulin Rouge, is a historical hotspot well worth a stop. Situated on the Left Bank, the establishment takes reservations, and we recommend making one well in advance. But with hundreds of bustling bars, nightclubs, and jazz haunts in the city, Moulin Rouge needn’t be your last stop of the night. Montmarte’s Au Lapin Agile was once frequented by Pablo Picasso, and these days, you can still catch a live show. At Le Duc des Lombards, in the 1st arrondissement, you can see some of the most respected local and international jazz musicians play informal sets. And for a hard-partying scene, try the Rex Club. Attached to the city’s renowned Cinema Rex in the 2nd arrondissement, it’s your spot for packed dance floors, thumping music, and on many nights, the beats of a world-famous DJ.</p>
